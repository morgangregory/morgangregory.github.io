title: "About Me"
---

I am a third-year statistics major at Appalachian State University. After I graduate, I hope to either go to graduate school at NC State or start my career working in data analytics or data science. Last summer, I was an analytics intern at MDI in Hickory, NC. During my internship, I analyzed data using Placer.ai and SiteSeer to help small grocery store owners make better marketing, merchandising, and relocation/expansion decisions.
